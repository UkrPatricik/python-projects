# ðŸ“˜ Patrickâ€™s Python Learning Roadmap â€” Progress Note (through Day 6)

## âœ… Completed so far
- Calculator: Built, refactored with helpers, added % and **, plus timeout feature.
- School Age App: Expanded with ranges, validation, and multi-user loop.
- Temperature Converter: Refactored with helpers, absolute zero check, and choice validation.
- Quiz Game: First mini-project with loops, input handling, and scoring.
- Squares & Cubes / Modulus Practice: Reinforced ** and % operators with practical mini-projects.
- GitHub: Successfully pushing daily; repo organized into folders (calculators/, converters/, games/, school/, practice/); helpers.py created for shared functions.
- Cheat Sheets: Git inspection and Git organizing PDFs created for reference.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Day 6 goals
- Mini-project: GCD/LCM calculator using Euclidâ€™s algorithm.
- Repo organization: Finish moving files into clean folders.
- Helpers: Centralize all reusable functions (numbers, operators, choices, timeout).
- Optional: Add README.md with project index.

## ðŸš€ Long-term goals
- Build a collection of small educational applications for students.
- Use trial-and-error learning + daily pushes to GitHub to grow confidence and muscle memory.
- Focus on clean code, input validation, and professional repo organization.
